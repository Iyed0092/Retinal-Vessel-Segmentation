# Retinal Vessel Segmentation with Vectorized Retina U-Net

This repository contains **another implementation of [Retina U-Net](https://github.com/orobix/retina-unet)** for retinal vessel segmentation, with fully vectorized operations for improved efficiency. The model is trained and evaluated on the **DRIVE dataset**, using a custom train/test split due to the absence of public test masks.

## üîç Project Highlights

- Another implementation of Retina U-Net with vectorized operations for faster training and inference.  
- Custom train/test split on the DRIVE dataset (80% train / 20% test) for evaluation.  
- Visual results including retinal images, ground truth masks, and model predictions.  
- Performance evaluation using **ROC** and **Precision-Recall curves**.
